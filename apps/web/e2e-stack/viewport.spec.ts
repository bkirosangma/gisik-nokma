/**
 * ## THE ONE VIEWPORT CASE THAT CANNOT LIVE IN `e2e-viewport/`
 *
 * `playwright.viewport.config.ts` covers the five routes reachable with no
 * session — `/help`, `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/sign-in`, the 404 — and that is the
 * right scope for a suite that starts its own `next dev` and talks to no server.
 *
 * **But the defect item 7 actually found was on the authenticated pages, and a
 * regression suite that cannot see the page the bug was on is decoration.**
 * `.gn-nav` overflowed the viewport by 10px at 390x844 on `/my-work`,
 * `/members`, both settings pages and the board — and on none of the unauthed
 * routes, because `AppNav` is the thing that overflowed and signed-out pages do
 * not render it. So the unauthed suite would have stayed green through the whole
 * bug, before and after.
 *
 * It is also not enough to sign in and stop at `/workspaces`: measured, that
 * page did NOT overflow while `/my-work` did. `AppNav` renders more links once a
 * workspace is in scope (`My Work`, and the rest), and it is the longer row that
 * runs past the edge. The case therefore has to reach a WORKSPACE-SCOPED page.
 *
 * WHY THE OVERFLOW IS DATA-DEPENDENT, which is what makes a fixed-width guess
 * the wrong fix: the row's last child is `Sign out {user.name}`, so its width
 * follows the signed-in user's name. 10px was the seeded owner's; a longer name
 * runs further. `.gn-nav` now sets `flex-wrap: wrap` (`globals.css`), which is
 * what every other flex row of its shape in the two stylesheets already did.
 *
 * THE INSTRUMENT ASSERTS ITSELF FIRST. `page.setViewportSize` is trusted by
 * nobody here: this repo has a recorded failure where a resize reported success
 * while the page kept reporting `innerWidth: 1512` and the screenshot was
 * byte-identical to the desktop one, twice on two different days. So the width
 * is read back INSIDE the page and asserted before any measurement is believed.
 * A viewport case that cannot tell whether the viewport applied measures the
 * default width and calls it a phone.

 * through the real door, reaches a WORKSPACE-SCOPED page (`AppNav`'s longer row,
 * the one that overflowed; `/workspaces` did not and would not have caught it),
 * asserts `window.innerWidth` really is 390 before measuring, then asserts
 * `documentElement.scrollWidth <= clientWidth + 1` AND that no element's rect
 * crosses the right edge — the second because a clipped child can leave
 * scrollWidth clean while still being unreachable.
