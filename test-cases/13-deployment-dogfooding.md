# 13 — Deployment & dogfooding

Mirrors `Features.md` §13. Status: `❌` not covered · `✅` covered · `🟡` partial · `🧪` covered by E2E only · `🚫` consciously out of scope. Test names cross-reference the covering test.

**Numbering is BLOCK-allocated across parallel lanes, controller-assigned 2026-09-06, because more than
one lane opened this section before Plan 11 Task 16's own catalogue pass (normally the sole opener, held
until Tasks 1–15 merge) could run: Lane C `13.1–13.40` (Task 14 landed at 13.1–13.6; Task 15 continues
inside the block) · Lane D `13.41–13.100` (Tasks 7–8 below, at 13.41–13.76; Tasks 9–10 continue inside the
block) · Lane E `13.101–13.200` (seam 1, Tasks 11–12, Task 13). Next block starts at `13.201`,
controller-allocated on request. Never renumber a landed id; a lane exhausting its block asks the
controller for another rather than borrowing a neighbour's.**

## Seed plumbing (Task 7)
- 13.41 ✅ `seedUlid` is a valid, `ULID_REGEX`-matching id — `seed-ulid.test.ts`
- 13.42 ✅ `seedUlid` is deterministic — the idempotence mechanism — `seed-ulid.test.ts`
- 13.43 ✅ `seedUlid` differs across keys and across namespaces — `seed-ulid.test.ts`
- 13.44 ✅ planted defect: a namespace/key join ambiguity cannot collide (`'ab'+'c'` vs `'a'+'bc'`) — `seed-ulid.test.ts`
- 13.45 ✅ `plainTextDoc` keeps record text literal — markdown-looking characters stay characters — `doc-text.test.ts`
- 13.46 ✅ `plainTextDoc` renders one paragraph per line; blank lines become empty paragraphs — `doc-text.test.ts`
- 13.47 ✅ `plainTextDoc('')` is still a valid one-paragraph doc — `doc-text.test.ts`
- 13.48 ✅ `findUserIdByEmail` queries better-auth's `"user"` table case-insensitively and returns the id — `users.test.ts`
- 13.49 ✅ `findUserIdByEmail` returns null when nobody has signed in with that address — the seed never invents people — `users.test.ts`
- 13.50 ✅ `checkErrandTemplate` accepts the real errand-with-waits template — `templates.test.ts`
- 13.51 ✅ planted defect: a template missing the `waiting` state is named — `templates.test.ts`
- 13.52 ✅ planted defect: a mapped state reachable only in two hops is refused — no fabricated intermediate claims — `templates.test.ts`
- 13.53 ✅ planted defect: `waiting` without `blocked: true` is named (attention-strip contract) — `templates.test.ts`
- 13.54 ✅ planted defect: an unguarded way into `done` is named (closing an errand must say what happened) — `templates.test.ts`
- 13.55 ✅ planted defect: a rule on the one-hop seeding transition is named — Ruling P29's tripwire — `templates.test.ts`
- 13.56 ✅ `workflowFromTemplate` clones with a fresh id at version 1, leaving the template untouched — `templates.test.ts`
- 13.57 ✅ Ruling P29 pinned by identity: the real template trips exactly two `rule-bypassable` advisories — `templates.test.ts`
- 13.58 ✅ Ruling P29: "fixing" one advisory genuinely silences that advisory by identity, and `checkErrandTemplate` still reddens — `templates.test.ts`
- 13.59 ✅ Ruling P29: guarding both `waiting` paths clears the advisory panel to zero, and `checkErrandTemplate` still refuses it — `templates.test.ts`

## Convenience Corner mapping (Task 8)
- 13.60 ✅ `readCcBoard` reads week1 and the items out of the frozen snapshot — `cc-board.test.ts`
- 13.61 ✅ the two operational epics hold exactly 23 errands in snapshot `24e2240` (13 registrations + 10 questions, 0 done) — `cc-board.test.ts`
- 13.62 ✅ planted defect: a file that does not define `window.CC_TRACKER` is refused with the path named (a `.ts` module throws inside the `vm` sandbox before any shape check runs — proven by wrapping the eval and rethrowing) — `cc-board.test.ts`
- 13.63 ✅ planted defect: a sandboxed global that is not `CC_TRACKER`, and a `CC_TRACKER` missing `items`, both exercise the shape-check branch itself (not just the syntax-error path) — `cc-board.test.ts`
- 13.64 ✅ `neededWeekEnd` reproduces the tracker generator's own week arithmetic (`build_tracker.py:390`) at weeks 0, 1, 7, 28 — `cc-map.test.ts`
- 13.65 ✅ invariant 4: an item with no asked/submitted date gets no `startDate` claim — `cc-map.test.ts`
- 13.66 ✅ invariant 4, the record's own natural planted defect: `ops:duns` carries an attention `since` but no origin `started` — no `startDate` claim — `cc-map.test.ts`
- 13.67 ✅ the one origin-dated item (`ops:accountant-hsn-digits`) gets its `startDate` claim verbatim, shaped `{date, note?}` — `cc-map.test.ts`
- 13.68 ✅ planted defect: stripping `needed_week` removes the `dueDate` claim — `cc-map.test.ts`
- 13.69 ✅ `needed_week` becomes a `dueDate` claim carrying the derivation in its note — `cc-map.test.ts`
- 13.70 ✅ statuses map without invention: `next`/`later`/`blocked` (→ `waiting`) map correctly, and a `later` item emits no transition — `cc-map.test.ts`
- 13.71 ✅ planted defect: a `done` item is refused — the seed never claims completion on anyone's behalf — `cc-map.test.ts`
- 13.72 ✅ planted defect: `done: true` against a stale non-done state string is still refused — the flag is checked, not just the state string — `cc-map.test.ts`
- 13.73 ✅ planted defect: an unknown tracker state is refused, never guessed — `cc-map.test.ts`
- 13.74 ✅ the body carries the record verbatim: tracker id, origin, counterparty/who, blocked-by resolved to the blocking item's human title, attention schedule, ask text — `cc-map.test.ts`
- 13.75 ✅ the description event carries the text as a literal-text doc, round-tripped through the domain's own `docToPlainText` — `cc-map.test.ts`
- 13.76 ✅ determinism: two builds of the same item are identical id-for-id; every event id is namespaced to the item so a re-snapshot cannot collide — `cc-map.test.ts`
