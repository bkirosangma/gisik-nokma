# 13. Deployment & dogfooding — test cases

Mirrors `Features.md` §13. Status: `❌` not covered · `✅` covered · `🟡` partial · `🧪` manual · `🚫` out of scope (with reason).

**Numbering, and why this file starts at 13.1.** `Features.md` §13 and this bucket belong to Plan 11 by
the coordination doc's reservation table. Plan 11's own Task 16 normally opens this section (held until
Tasks 1–15 merge) and would pin its own numbering across the whole plan. Tasks 14 and 15 landed ahead of
that, in separate PRs — lifted to close the Plan 5 gate's CI precondition sooner — so this file opens the
bucket early: 13.1–13.6 are Task 14's (added first), 13.7+ are Task 15's, continuing from Task 14's
then-highest id rather than renumbering. **Never renumber**: when Task 16, or any of Tasks 1–13, land,
they continue from this file's then-highest id in turn, exactly as `09-editor-attachments.md` and
`12-offline-sync-apps.md` did for the reservation gaps they each recorded.

**IDS IN §13 ARE ALLOCATED, NOT DISCOVERED — the same collision class §12 recorded, one file over: Lane D
independently minted its own 13.1–13.36 for Tasks 7/8 against this file's 13.1–13.6, from a fork point
that couldn't see this branch.** Blocks, controller-allocated 2026-09-06: **Lane C 13.1–13.40** (Tasks 14
[13.1–13.6, pushed] and 15 [13.7+, this PR]) · **Lane D 13.41–13.100** (Tasks 7, 8) · **Lane E
13.101–13.200** (the rest of Plan 11). **The next free block is `13.201`, controller-allocated ON REQUEST
ONLY.** A lane takes its assigned block and does not derive the next free id from this file — recount the
MAXIMUM in use against `origin/main` at every rebase as the control, but never mint from it.

**Numbering is BLOCK-allocated across parallel lanes, controller-assigned 2026-09-06, because more than
one lane opened this section before Plan 11 Task 16's own catalogue pass (normally the sole opener, held
until Tasks 1–15 merge) could run: Lane C `13.1–13.40` (Task 14 landed at 13.1–13.6; Task 15 continues
inside the block) · Lane D `13.41–13.100` (Tasks 7–8 below, at 13.41–13.76; Tasks 9–10 continue inside the
block) · Lane E `13.101–13.200` (seam 1, Tasks 11–12, Task 13). Next block starts at `13.201`,
controller-allocated on request. Never renumber a landed id; a lane exhausting its block asks the
controller for another rather than borrowing a neighbour's.**

Nothing in the Task 14/15 section below is proven by an automated test in the usual `vitest` sense —
there is no test runner for GitHub Actions YAML. `🧪` there means: reproduced by hand against the actual
tools involved (actionlint, a real vitest run), not inferred from reading the YAML. The Tasks 7/8 section
below it is ordinary `vitest` coverage and uses `✅` throughout.

## CI pipeline and deploy spec (Tasks 14–15)

- 🧪 **13.1 — a docs-only diff still runs the ledger gate.** `check-tasks` is not gated on the
  `scope` job's `code_changed` output (unlike every other job below it), because the ledger it checks
  lives under `docs/lanes/` and a ledger-only promotion PR is exactly the docs-only case the `scope`
  job's own rule exempts everything else for. Reproduced: `node scripts/check-task-ledger.mjs` run
  standalone, no `pnpm install`, exits 0 against the current ledger. `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  (`check-tasks` job), `scripts/check-task-ledger.mjs`
- 🧪 **13.2 — the server suite shards without dropping or duplicating tests.** `vitest run
  --shard=N/4` against `apps/server/test` (90 files) was reproduced locally at two different shard
  counts (`1/2`+`2/2` against a real multi-file directory) — each file appeared in exactly one shard's
  results, both shards reported `success: true`. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (`server-tests` job)
- 🧪 **13.3 — a fully-skipped `skipIf` suite fails the gate instead of passing quietly, including the
  zero-evidence case.** `check-no-silent-skips.mjs` reproduced against four planted probe files (not
  committed): a file with no `.skipIf(` usage (ignored), a file with a `.skipIf(true)` guard AND a normal
  passing test in the same file (passes — partial skip is fine), a file whose entire content is behind
  `.skipIf(true)` (exit 1, names the file), and — the case an opus review found this script's first
  version got backwards — a `.skipIf(` guard wrapping a loop over an EMPTY fixture list (`for (const f of
  fixtures) it(f, ...)` with `fixtures = []`), which collects zero assertionResults entirely rather than
  skipped ones; the first version's `assertions.length > 0 &&` guard let this print "ok" and exit 0, which
  is exactly the silently-empty-suite case the script exists to catch. Fixed by dropping that guard; all
  four probes now behave correctly. No shipped file in this repo uses `.skipIf(` yet — this case is ahead
  of its first real trigger, which Plan 11 Tasks 11/12 will provide. `scripts/check-no-silent-skips.mjs`
- 🧪 **13.4 — a `.skipIf(` guard landing outside the one job that checks for silent skips fails the
  gate instead of shipping unguarded.** `check-skipif-coverage.mjs` — found missing by the same opus
  review, since `check-no-silent-skips.mjs` only runs inside `server-tests`, leaving all 8 other packages
  (and any file inside `apps/server` outside the `test/` prefix) covered by nothing — reproduced against
  the real repo (245 test files, exit 0, none outside `apps/server/test/`) and against a planted, staged
  `.skipIf(` file under `packages/domain/test/` (exit 1, names the file). `scripts/check-skipif-coverage.mjs`
- ❌ **13.5 — the postgres-client-16 install actually resolves on `ubuntu-latest`.** Not verified —
  this repository's only linter for GitHub Actions YAML (`actionlint`) does not execute apt installs,
  and this task's environment cannot run an Ubuntu Actions runner directly. The install step now runs
  `pg_dump --version | grep -q ' 16\.'` as its own falsifiable check immediately after the apt install, so
  if the assumption (`ubuntu-latest` resolves to a distro whose default PostgreSQL major is 16) is ever
  wrong, the job fails naming the mismatch rather than silently running whatever version apt gave it.
  Confirm from the PR's own CI run before treating this case as ✅. `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  (`server-tests` job)
- 🧪 **13.6 — the `e2e` job never mistakes an unrelated file for Task 13's compose-based E2E readiness.**
  The first version gated on `docker-compose.dev.yml` AND `apps/web/playwright.config.ts` both existing —
  an opus review found the second file **already exists on `origin/main` today**, for a deliberately
  off-gate mock-only smoke (`apps/web/playwright.config.ts`'s own docblock: "It is not on the gate and it
  must not become so by accident"). The first version would have started running that mock smoke against
  a compose stack it never touches the moment ANY `docker-compose.dev.yml` appeared at the repo root, for
  any reason — reporting compose-based E2E coverage the gate would not actually have. Fixed: the job now
  checks only for `docker-compose.dev.yml` (Task 13's one known, not-yet-existing artifact) and never
  attempts to run anything even once that file exists — it prints that Task 13 must supply the real
  invocation, rather than guessing one. Reproduced: confirmed `apps/web/playwright.config.ts` exists on
  this branch today (verifying the bug was real, not hypothetical); the job's own logic change was
  verified by reading, not by a real Actions run — confirm from the PR's own CI run once Task 13 lands
  that this job does not silently start running the mock smoke. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (`e2e` job)
- 🧪 **13.7 — the deploy spec's object-storage and web-client env var names match what code actually
  reads, not the plan's original draft.** `pnpm check:env` passes unchanged after `deploy/do/app.yaml`
  was written using `OBJECT_STORE`, `OBJECT_STORE_S3_ENDPOINT`, `OBJECT_STORE_S3_REGION`,
  `OBJECT_STORE_S3_BUCKET`, `OBJECT_STORE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `OBJECT_STORE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`,
  `OBJECT_STORE_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE` (confirmed by `check:env`'s own output as the names
  `apps/server/src/attachments/store-config.ts` destructures) and `SERVER_ORIGIN`/
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` (confirmed as the names `apps/web/next.config.ts` and
  `apps/web/src/providers.tsx` actually read) — not the plan's original `S3_*` /
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL`, none of which any shipped code reads. Independently
  re-verified by a sonnet review agent reading every one of those source files directly, which found
  one comment-precision nit (fixed) and no functional defect. `deploy/do/app.yaml`
- 🧪 **13.8 — the database-timezone check is genuinely falsifiable, against the failure mode that
  actually would have hidden a broken deployment.** `check-db-timezone.mjs` reproduced against a
  throwaway database explicitly `ALTER`ed to `UTC` (exit 1, names the wrong zone and the fix). The first
  attempt to prove this — pointing the check at the shared dev Postgres's own admin `postgres` database,
  expecting it to fail because nothing had `ALTER`ed it — instead PASSED, because
  `docker-compose.yml`'s `-c timezone=Asia/Kolkata` sets the timezone at the **cluster** level, so every
  database on that server (the admin one included) already answers `Asia/Kolkata` with no per-database
  `ALTER` anywhere — exactly the trap the plan's own suggested falsifiability demo (pointing at "the dev
  compose Postgres has not been altered yet") would have fallen into, independently confirmed by a
  cross-lane review as a real bug in the plan text, not this file. The corrected demo (a database
  explicitly forced to `UTC`, overriding the cluster default) is what actually falsifies the check.
  `scripts/check-db-timezone.mjs`

## Seed plumbing (Task 7)
- 13.41 ✅ `seedUlid` is a valid, `ULID_REGEX`-matching id — `seed-ulid.test.ts`
- 13.42 ✅ `seedUlid` is deterministic — the idempotence mechanism — `seed-ulid.test.ts`
- 13.43 ✅ `seedUlid` differs across keys and across namespaces — `seed-ulid.test.ts`
- 13.44 ✅ planted defect: a namespace/key join ambiguity cannot collide (`'ab'+'c'` vs `'a'+'bc'`) — `seed-ulid.test.ts`
- 13.45 ✅ `plainTextDoc` keeps record text literal — markdown-looking characters stay characters — `doc-text.test.ts`
- 13.46 ✅ `plainTextDoc` renders one paragraph per line; blank lines become empty paragraphs — `doc-text.test.ts`
- 13.47 ✅ `plainTextDoc('')` is still a valid one-paragraph doc — `doc-text.test.ts`
- 13.48 ✅ `findUserIdByEmail` queries better-auth's `"user"` table case-insensitively and returns the id — `users.test.ts`
- 13.49 ✅ `findUserIdByEmail` returns null when nobody has signed in with that address — the seed never invents people — `users.test.ts`
- 13.50 ✅ `checkErrandTemplate` accepts the real errand-with-waits template — `templates.test.ts`
- 13.51 ✅ planted defect: a template missing the `waiting` state is named — `templates.test.ts`
- 13.52 ✅ planted defect: a mapped state reachable only in two hops is refused — no fabricated intermediate claims — `templates.test.ts`
- 13.53 ✅ planted defect: `waiting` without `blocked: true` is named (attention-strip contract) — `templates.test.ts`
- 13.54 ✅ planted defect: an unguarded way into `done` is named (closing an errand must say what happened) — `templates.test.ts`
- 13.55 ✅ planted defect: a rule on the one-hop seeding transition is named — Ruling P29's tripwire — `templates.test.ts`
- 13.56 ✅ `workflowFromTemplate` clones with a fresh id at version 1, leaving the template untouched — `templates.test.ts`
- 13.57 ✅ Ruling P29 pinned by identity: the real template trips exactly two `rule-bypassable` advisories — `templates.test.ts`
- 13.58 ✅ Ruling P29: "fixing" one advisory genuinely silences that advisory by identity, and `checkErrandTemplate` still reddens — `templates.test.ts`
- 13.59 ✅ Ruling P29: guarding both `waiting` paths clears the advisory panel to zero, and `checkErrandTemplate` still refuses it — `templates.test.ts`

## Convenience Corner mapping (Task 8)
- 13.60 ✅ `readCcBoard` reads week1 and the items out of the frozen snapshot — `cc-board.test.ts`
- 13.61 ✅ the two operational epics hold exactly 23 errands in snapshot `24e2240` (13 registrations + 10 questions, 0 done) — `cc-board.test.ts`
- 13.62 ✅ planted defect: a file that does not define `window.CC_TRACKER` is refused with the path named (a `.ts` module throws inside the `vm` sandbox before any shape check runs — proven by wrapping the eval and rethrowing) — `cc-board.test.ts`
- 13.63 ✅ planted defect: a sandboxed global that is not `CC_TRACKER`, and a `CC_TRACKER` missing `items`, both exercise the shape-check branch itself (not just the syntax-error path) — `cc-board.test.ts`
- 13.64 ✅ `neededWeekEnd` reproduces the tracker generator's own week arithmetic (`build_tracker.py:390`) at weeks 0, 1, 7, 28 — `cc-map.test.ts`
- 13.65 ✅ invariant 4: an item with no asked/submitted date gets no `startDate` claim — `cc-map.test.ts`
- 13.66 ✅ invariant 4, the record's own natural planted defect: `ops:duns` carries an attention `since` but no origin `started` — no `startDate` claim — `cc-map.test.ts`
- 13.67 ✅ the one origin-dated item (`ops:accountant-hsn-digits`) gets its `startDate` claim verbatim, shaped `{date, note?}` — `cc-map.test.ts`
- 13.68 ✅ planted defect: stripping `needed_week` removes the `dueDate` claim — `cc-map.test.ts`
- 13.69 ✅ `needed_week` becomes a `dueDate` claim carrying the derivation in its note — `cc-map.test.ts`
- 13.70 ✅ statuses map without invention: `next`/`later`/`blocked` (→ `waiting`) map correctly, and a `later` item emits no transition — `cc-map.test.ts`
- 13.71 ✅ planted defect: a `done` item is refused — the seed never claims completion on anyone's behalf — `cc-map.test.ts`
- 13.72 ✅ planted defect: `done: true` against a stale non-done state string is still refused — the flag is checked, not just the state string — `cc-map.test.ts`
- 13.73 ✅ planted defect: an unknown tracker state is refused, never guessed — `cc-map.test.ts`
- 13.74 ✅ the body carries the record verbatim: tracker id, origin, counterparty/who, blocked-by resolved to the blocking item's human title, attention schedule, ask text — `cc-map.test.ts`
- 13.75 ✅ the description event carries the text as a literal-text doc, round-tripped through the domain's own `docToPlainText` — `cc-map.test.ts`
- 13.76 ✅ determinism: two builds of the same item are identical id-for-id; every event id is namespaced to the item so a re-snapshot cannot collide — `cc-map.test.ts`
