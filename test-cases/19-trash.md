# §19 — Archive, delete and purge

**Opened 2026-09-23 by Plan 1 of the trash series** (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-23-trash-1-lifecycle-core.md`;
spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-23-trash-and-purge-design.md`).

## THE ID SHAPE

§19 is uniformly 3-digit padded: `19.001`–`19.999`, following §17's and §18's ruling. Blocks are allocated per plan
in the table below. Take from your block, never from the tip.

| Plan | Block |
|---|---|
| 1 Lifecycle core | `19.001`–`19.080` |
| 2 Purge engine | `19.081`–`19.160` |
| 3 Replica + sync | `19.161`–`19.200` |
| 4 UI | `19.201`–`19.260` |

**Write cases as `- ❌ **19.001 — …**` id LINES.** The guard (`scripts/check-case-ids.mjs`) counts id LINES and
nothing else; four spellings are invisible to it (a markdown **table row**, a **`##` heading**, a **backticked**
id inside the bold, and **two ids in one sentence**). After adding cases, confirm the count moved by EXACTLY
the number you added — an unchanged count has reported a clean sweep over cases it never saw.

## 19.1 Vocabulary

- ✅ **19.001 — each of the eight lifecycle types parses against its entity kind with `{}`;** control: the same type against a wrong kind is refused with `entity-kind-mismatch`. Mutation: register `project.deleted` with `entityKind: 'workspace'`.
- ✅ **19.002 — every lifecycle payload refuses a stranger's field** (`{ projectId: 'x' }`, `{ dueAt: '…' }` on `purge.marked`); control: `{}` accepted. Mutation: drop `.strict()` from `purgeMarkedPayload`.
- ✅ **19.003 — `purge.marked`/`purge.unmarked` parse against `workspace`, `project`, `ticket` and `note`, and are refused against `workflow`;** control: `note`. Mutation: omit `'note'` from the kinds.
- ✅ **19.004 — `purgeDueAt('2026-09-23T10:00:00.000Z')` is `'2026-10-08T10:00:00.000Z'`;** control: the result is `PURGE_DELAY_DAYS` days after the input to the millisecond. Mutation: `PURGE_DELAY_DAYS = 14`.
